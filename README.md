# Cookie-Clicker-React
ðŸŽ¯ Please mention the requirements you met and which goals you achieved for this assignment.

I think I did all that was required of me for the 3 marks but not 100% sure. I did do a stretch goal in that I added the local storage so that the player can keep their progress even after page refreshes. Also added a reset progress button so they can start fresh if they wanted.

ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were not quite able to achieve?

I am not too sure honestly, like I said, I'm fairly confident I did everything for the 3 marks but still not 100% so I'll have to wait for the marking. 

ðŸŽ¯ If so, could you please tell us what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

The thing I found most difficult was just getting to grips with how React actually worked. Everytime we go onto a new coding language my brain is confused for at least the first week then it slowly comes round to it. It was definitely similar to HTML and JavaScript put together but I tripped up on small differences along my assignment and frequently had to google my way through to see what the problem was. I have learnt a lot about React by doing this assignment for sure
